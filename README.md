# stretch_docking

**WARNING: THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND RUNNING THE CODE ON YOUR ROBOT.**

This is an in-progress demo that uses visual servoing to autonomously dock a Stretch 3 robot with the official Hello Robot docking station. The code is under active development with minimal testing. While you should feel free to look around this repository, we do not recommend running the code, yet.

We'll update this documentation when it's worth trying out.
